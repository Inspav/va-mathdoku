## Rules

The game will generate a square grid no smaller than 2x2 and no larger than 8x8.
Complete the grid following these rules:

1. Each row and column must contain all the numbers from 1 to the size of the grid,
for example a 6x6 grid would have numbers from 1 to 6. You cannot have repeating
numbers on a row or column.
2. Squares will be walled off into sections. Each section has a mathematical
operation to hint at the numbers it should contain. For addition and multiplication,
add or multiply the numbers in any order until you reach the target. For subtraction
and division the numbers are subtracted or divided from the largest number.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys or press on the squares to select them. Numbers can be input using
the keyboard or by double clicking on the square to open an input screen.
